                    "The tour will begin at 4:30 a.m. with pick-up at your hotel to head to Acomayo, where we will start the hike towards Laguna Qentercocha (4,330 m.a.s.l. / 14,138 feet), where we will enjoy breakfast. Then, we will begin the hike towards the Waqrapukara complex, identifying flora and fauna along the way. Upon reaching a viewpoint of the archaeological complex, we will pause for photos. Afterwards, we will continue to the archaeological center, where we will rest and explore with the guide, who will provide detailed information. After some free time for photos, we will start the return via a different path, enjoying new landscapes of the Apurímac Canyon. We will return to the trailhead around 2:00 p.m. for lunch before returning to Cusco, arriving approximately at 7:00 p.m. Travelers must be in good physical condition and properly acclimated to the altitude."
